# common settings for all environments
common:
  # Solution stack for elastic beanstalk, default is 64bit tomcat 7 for JAVA app
  # solution_stack_name: 64bit Amazon Linux running Tomcat 7

  # AWS region to deploy. Default to us-east-1
  # region: us-west-1

  # There are two deployment strategies: blue-green or inplace-update.
  # Blue green keep two elastic beanstalk environments and always deploy to
  # inactive one, to achive zero downtime. inplace-update strategy
  # will only keep one environment, and update the version inplace on
  # deploy. inplace-update will save resources but will have downtime. Default
  # strategy is blue-green. PS. All old environments need be destroyed when you
  # switching between strategies.
  # strategy: blue-green

  # If phoenix mode is turn on, it will terminate the old elastic
  # beanstalk environment and recreate on deploy. For blue-green
  # deployment it terminate the inactive environment first then
  # recreate it. This is useful to avoiding configuration drift and
  # accumulating state on the ec2 instances. Also it has the benifit of
  # keeping your ec2 instance system package upto date, because everytime ec2
  # instance boot up from AMI it does a system update. Default is off but we suggest
  # overriden it to on for production environment.
  # phoenix_mode: false

  # Generating version label for package be deployed. A readable version label will
  # provide better traceablity of your deployment process.
  # By default setting is:
  # version_label: <%= package_digest %>
  # which means using MD5 digest of the package file. If you deploy using build
  # pipeline tool such as GO, switching to pipline counter is highly suggested to
  # increase the readability. Following example read pipeline counter from environment
  # variable with a fall back to digest for local deployment:
  # version_label: <%= ENV['GO_PIPELINE_COUNTER'] || package_digest %>


  # Smoke test value should be a piece of ruby code with access to single variable
  # "host_name" -- environment DNS name. Smoke test snippet will be evaluated at
  # the end of the deployment for inplace-update deployment. For blue-green
  # deployment it will run after inactive environment update finish and before
  # switching.
  # Defining a smoke test is high recommended for serious usage. The
  # simplest one could just be checking server landing page using curl, e.g.
  smoke_test: |
    curl_http_code = "curl -s -o /dev/null -w \"%{http_code}\" http://#{host_name}"
    Timeout.timeout(600) do
      until ['200', '302'].include?(`#{curl_http_code}`.strip)
        sleep 5
      end
    end

  # Elastic Beanstalk settings that will apply to the environments you
  # deploying.
  # For all available options take a look at
  # http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/command-options.html
  option_settings:
    # Following is an option_settings example which changes EC2 instance type
    # from t1.micro (default) to m1.small. Intances with t1.micro type sometime
    # are not very responsible, so m1.small is suggested for saving time.
    # But if you care about the marginal cost difference you can comment this out to
    # go back to t1.micro.
    - namespace: aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration
      option_name: InstanceType
      value: m1.small

  # If resources specified, eb_deployer will use the CloudFormation
  # template you provide to create a default CloudFormation stack with
  # name <application_name>-<env-name> for the environment current
  # deploying. And Outputs of the CloudFormation can be mapped to Elastic Beanstalk
  # options settings.
  # keys:
  #    template => CloudFormation template file with JSON format
  #    inputs => A Hash, input values for the CloudFormation template
  #    outputs => A Hash with key map to your CloudFormation
  # template outputs and value as elastic beanstalk settings namespace and option_name.
  #    :capabilities => An array. You need set it to ['CAPABILITY_IAM'] if the
  # template include IAM Instance Profile.
  resources:
    # For example creating a RDS instance for blue green deployment:
    template: config/my_rds.json
